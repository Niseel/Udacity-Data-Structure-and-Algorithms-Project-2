## Explanation: Linked List Implementation with Union and Intersection

### Requirement:
The goal of this implementation is to create a linked list data structure in Python, which can store a sequence of values. Additionally, we want to provide functionality to compute the union and intersection of two linked lists. The union of two lists contains all unique elements from both lists, while the intersection contains only the elements common to both lists.

### Implementation Overview:
The code consists of two main classes: `Node` and `LinkedList`, along with two functions: `union` and `intersection`.

### Class Node:
The `Node` class represents an individual element (or node) in the linked list. Each node contains:

- `value`: The value stored in the node.
- `next`: A reference to the next node in the linked list, initially set to `None`.

### Class LinkedList:
The `LinkedList` class manages the collection of nodes and provides several methods:

- **Attributes:**
  - `head`: A reference to the first node in the linked list.

- **Methods:**
  - `__init__`: Initializes an empty linked list with the head set to `None`.
  - `__str__`: Returns a string representation of the entire linked list, formatted to show the sequence of values.
  - `append`: Adds a new node with a specified value to the end of the linked list.
  - `size`: Returns the number of nodes in the linked list by traversing from the head to the end.

### Function: Union
The `union` function takes two linked lists as input and creates a new linked list that contains all unique values from both lists.

### Function: Intersection
The `intersection` function computes the common values between two linked lists and constructs a new linked list containing these values.

### Testing:
The testing function provides three test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the union and intersection operations:

- **Test Case 1:** Combines two lists with some common values, checking for both the union and intersection.
- **Test Case 2:** Tests the behavior when there are duplicate values in both lists.
- **Test Case 3:** Tests the edge case of both lists being empty.

### Time and Space Complexity:
#### Time Complexity:
- The `append` method runs in O(n) for each linked list due to traversal, making the union and intersection operations O(n + m), where n and m are the sizes of the two linked lists.
- The `size` method also runs in O(n).

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity for storing unique values in the union operation is O(n + m) in the worst case. The intersection function also uses O(n + m) in the worst case for the sets used to store values.

### Conclusion:
This implementation efficiently models a linked list and provides clear methods for union and intersection operations, showcasing fundamental data structure principles in Python. The code structure allows for easy extensions and modifications for further operations or features related to linked lists.
